First you need to have kodi installed on PC, Android or iPhone and the link to the file.

Second: Open kodi and go to Add-ons =》 Install from repository =》 Find Kodi Add-on repository and click it (If you have more then 1 repository) =》PVR Clients =》Find PVR IPTV Simple Client and install it

Third: After the PVR IPTV Simple Client is intalled, you need to go to My Add-ons =》 PVR clients =》 PVR IPTV Simple Client =》 Click on Configure
